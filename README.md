# Simple-CRUD-with-MERN
### What is CRUD?

CRUD is stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. They are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most.

### What is MERN?

MERN is stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications.
1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database

MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

2. Express: Back-End Framework

Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code.

3. React: Front-End Library

React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces.

4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment

Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser).
